"""Image provenance: identify where an image was made and what watermarks it carries.

Aggregates every locally-readable signal into a single :class:`ProvenanceReport`:

- **C2PA Content Credentials** (issuer, claim generator, digital source type) ->
  the signing platform (OpenAI, Google, Adobe, Microsoft).
- **IPTC ``digitalSourceType``** "Made with AI" marker (Meta, X, others).
- **PNG text / EXIF generation parameters** (Stable Diffusion, ComfyUI, InvokeAI).
- **SynthID metadata proxy** -- a C2PA companion from a SynthID-using vendor
  (Google / OpenAI) implies the invisible pixel watermark.
- **Visible Gemini sparkle** (optional; needs cv2/numpy, no GPU).

Hard limit: a stripped image (re-encoded, screenshotted, social-media upload)
loses all metadata, and the SynthID *pixel* watermark is not locally decodable
(proprietary decoder). Absence of signals is therefore reported as ``Unknown``,
never as "clean". See CLAUDE.md "SynthID detection is metadata-only".
