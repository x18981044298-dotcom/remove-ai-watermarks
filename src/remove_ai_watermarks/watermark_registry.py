"""Registry of known visible watermarks.

A single catalog that ties each known visible mark to (a) where it usually sits,
(b) how to recognize it there, and (c) how to remove it. One pass over the
registry detects every known mark in its usual place and removes the ones
present.

**Reverse-alpha based.** A known mark is a fixed semi-transparent overlay, so it
is removed by inverting the alpha blend against a captured alpha map
(``original = (wm - a*logo)/(1-a)``) -- recovering the true pixels rather than
inpainting a guess. Gemini and Doubao recover exactly with no inpaint at native on
bright/flat backgrounds (Gemini falls back to inpainting the sparkle footprint when
reverse-alpha would over-subtract on a dark background -- issue #30, see gemini_engine);
Jimeng adds a thin residual inpaint over the glyph footprint to clear the outline
its per-image render variation leaves behind (still seeded by the reverse-alpha
recovery, not a blind inpaint). Detection is consistent with that: each mark is
recognized by matching its known shape/template (the thing we invert), not by
heuristics. A mark is therefore listed here only once a real alpha map has been
captured for it; everything else (arbitrary logos/objects) is the user-directed
``erase --region`` tool, not this catalog.

Entries:
  - ``gemini`` -- Google Gemini / Nano Banana sparkle, bottom-right.
  - ``doubao`` -- ByteDance Doubao "豆包AI生成" text strip, bottom-right.
  - ``jimeng`` -- ByteDance Jimeng / Dreamina "★ 即梦AI" wordmark, bottom-right.
  - ``samsung`` -- Samsung Galaxy AI "Contenuti generati dall'AI" strip, bottom-left.
